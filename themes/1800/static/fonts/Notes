I care too much about these fonts

Alphabet of Children is built from the "Alphabet-of-Children-source.ttf" from
Dive into HTML5's repo. Minor tweaks have been made to some characters, and the
previously absent "V" has been filled by the "U" character

Symbola has a modified U+2767 "Rotated Floral Heart Bullet" to a style I like
better. It resembles the U+2766 "Floral Heart" rotated to point right, and
with the curves completed not awkwardly cut off.

Symbola-Lite contains only the glyphs I actually use

Essays1743 has all of its arrows scaled 200% and re-centered

Alegreya has it's hyphen charactered copied into U+2011 Non-Breaking Hyphen
