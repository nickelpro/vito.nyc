_This post is was written rather hastily as a college essay writing assignment
and not reflective of anything other than the imminent deadline. This note was
added after is was graded._ 🙂

Bureaucracy in the mind of the average American is typically a _prescriptive_
arm of government. It is the clerk at the DMV, demanding yet one more proof of
identity, or the stamp of approval from the county's Building Code Advisory
Board to put up a shed in the backyard. However there is nothing in the
structure of bureaucracy, in the United States or elsewhere, that restricts it
to these duties.

Lacking any reason not to, the bureaucracy has evolved into a _descriptive_
mechanism designed to short circuit legislative process. The impetus for this
evolution is a response to failings of democratic systems. In this post we'll
briefly explore the whys and hows of that evolution.


## A Layman's Democracy

As a student in American public school I learned about the basic process of
American governance the same way that many in my generation did: ***School House
Rock***.

From that _absolute bop_ of a video one might draw the conclusion that this
process is how all laws and regulations come to fruition, but we can already
see the shortcomings of this system. As our friend the Bill points out, "I'm
one of the lucky ones, most bills never even get this far." Most bills die in
committee, or are filibustered so they can never come to a vote. These bills
aren't unimportant or unworthy, they address problems facing the American
people where truly, "their oughta be a law".

There exist problems where a bad or imperfect law can do more harm than good,
but there also exist a plethora of problems where any law would be better than
no law. When it comes to issues like food safety, environmental protection, or
commercial licensing, it's hard to do worse than _no law at all_. Here the
parliamentary system so artfully described by ***School House*** comes to a
crashing halt. These types of problems need expert and (relative to Congress)
dynamic shepherds.

Congress has recognized this problem, or more probably finds dealing with these
issues very tiresome, and has recruited such shepherds. These are the
_independent federal agencies_, and they are legion.

## Shepherds of the Republic

An _independent federal agency_ is
[defined by the Supreme Court](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/295/602/)
as an agency with "quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers" and belonging to
those respective branches of government (insomuch as they belong to any
branch of government). The truth of the matter is they are independent
executives, beholden to no one directly. Some are considered so outside of
government that short of neglect of duty or malfeasance their officers cannot
be fired, even by the President.

These bureaucratic structures are born from _enabling-acts_, such as [the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-act)
which established the FDA. They are staffed by career civil servants and headed
up by presidential appointees confirmed by Congress. This creates a
Constitutional tightrope. The powers of the agencies are derived from
democratically elected individuals, but none of the people writing the
rules and regulations were themselves elected.

And write rules they do, the number of rules issued by independent agencies
dwarfs the rate that Congress passes laws [at a ratio of 18-to-1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynecrews/2017/08/15/how-many-rules-and-regulations-do-federal-agencies-issue/?sh=6294ce471e64).
While the Senate celebrated moving from a "one-track" to a ["two-track" system](
https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/how-the-modern-faux-filibuster-came-to-be/255374/)
back in 1975, doubling the number of laws it can drag its feet on at a time,
the various agencies wrote and enacted new rules and regulatory
actions by the thousands.

Which is to say, the bureaucracy is not merely part of government it is
**most** of government.

{{< img src="officials" imgstyle="border-radius:4em;" />}}

This isn't to say that the bureaucracy is ineffective, quite the contrary. The
Federal Reserve for example, foremost among and one of the most independent of
the federal agencies, has done a formidable job of guiding an the American
economy to prosperity. The ability to appoint knowledgeable economists and
business people to chair the agency and allow them act decisively and
unilaterally is widely recognized as in the public interest.

The question moving forward should not be: how can democracy claw back control
from the bureaucracy? The numbers demonstrate that's a lost cause. The question
is: what can democracy _learn_ from the bureaucracy?

## Lessons of the Bureaucrat

Far from the stereotype of being bogged down by paperwork and procedure, the
federal agencies move at a blazing speed compared to Congress. This is the
prime take-away from the rise of the administrative state. Bureaucracies exist
not to slow-down government, but rather arise to signal the procedures of
government are failing to respond to dynamic situations.

[Recent push-back](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/joe-biden-says-senate-filibuster-being-abused-must-be-changed-n1262079)
against filibusters and the use of workarounds such as [budget
reconciliation](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-politics-blockades-coronavirus-pandemic-e465061d956aec299eebc4d59f92ebfa)
demonstrate recognition of this flaw in the legislative process. A system that
could pass imperfect laws without fear, because it was also capable of passing
legislation that revisited and improved those laws would be a world ahead of
the obstructive inaction of the now.

Ultimately, we cannot be more poorly served than with the democratically
elected representatives frozen, and the appointed bureaucrats ablaze.
Fittingly, any action, even imperfect, would be good action.
