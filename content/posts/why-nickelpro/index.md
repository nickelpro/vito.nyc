This is a pretty common question, enough that I can milk it for some blog
content. The short answer is this, I've been `nickelpro` for as long as I've
been on the internet. My site is `nickelp.ro` because `nickel.pro` got sniped
by a [domain squatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting) before I
could get to it, back when `.pro` TLDs cost waaaay too much money. The domain
has grown on me over the years, since `.pro` is supposed to be for
professionals and I've never been much of a professional anything.

## But why nickelpro?

Well, for starters, I lied! I haven't always been `nickelpro`, my first ever
handle was the much more mature and measured `ioublood`. It was the most
intimidating thing my 10-year old mind could come up with back in 2004. That
tag served as my _nom de guerre_ for pwning noobs on
[Warcraft 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos).

It was also the tag I used when first dipping my toes in less-than-kosher
online activities. No one reading this will have been involved with the Xbox
360 hacking scene back around 2009, but I was and for some reason I took
pictures!

I mostly spent time hanging out in [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)
channels run by much better hackers than me, but I had a small role in popularizing
a couple hacks and if you Google "`ioublood`" today you'll find some cringey
posts of teenage me trying to pose as someone who knew a lot more than I actually
did.

## Neat, but why nickelpro?

Ben Foddy and Zach Gage gave an [excellent talk](https://youtu.be/N4UFC0y1tY0)
at GDC this year about taking credit for your work, instead of hiding behind a
studio or company name. In 2005 I was eleven years old and work attribution was
of immense importance to me. Specifically, my best friend Elliot and I had been
making state-of-the-art stop motion videos of our shoes walking around on their
own. Magnificent stuff.

We intended to present this work to the students and faculty of Northport Middle
School via the weekly student run broadcast, internet streaming before it was
cool. The question arose, how should we credit ourselves? Come up with a cool
production company name, or just throw our names on it? We split the difference.

Nick Elliot Productions.

`nickelpro`

In 2007 when Gmail went public I registered the username on a whim. When I outgrew
`ioublood`, `nickelpro` became my persona by default.
